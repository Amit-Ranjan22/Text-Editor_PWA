## Description

JATE is not only a text editor that runs in the browser, but it is also a Progressive Web App with a number of data persistence measures serving as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser, or online connectivity is lost. The app uses the `idb` package methods to get and store data to an IndexedDB database.
